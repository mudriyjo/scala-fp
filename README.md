# Scala Learning Project

This project serves as a hands-on exploration and learning journey into the Scala programming language, inspired by the comprehensive courses provided on Udemy by [Rock the JVM - Scala for Beginners](https://udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/) and [Advanced Scala](https://udemy.com/course/advanced-scala) by Daniel CiocÃ®rlan.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to deepen understanding of Scala programming and functional programming concepts through practical implementation. It is designed as a learning exercise to delve into the core mechanisms of Scala, with a focus on functional programming principles.

## Courses Source

The project draws inspiration and guidance from the Udemy courses by Daniel CiocÃ®rlan:

- [Rock the JVM - Scala for Beginners](https://udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/)
- [Advanced Scala](https://udemy.com/course/advanced-scala/)

## Learning Objectives

- **Foundational Understanding:** Develop a solid grasp of Scala syntax, functional programming principles, and overall language features.
- **Practical Implementation:** Apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on coding exercises and projects.
- **Deep Mechanism Exploration:** Explore the intricacies of Scala and delve into advanced functional programming concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to align with the topics covered in the Udemy courses. Each section corresponds to specific concepts and exercises, providing a structured approach to learning Scala and functional programming.
